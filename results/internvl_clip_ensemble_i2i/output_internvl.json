                "model_description": "The image shows a graph with a red curve and a grid background. The x-axis ranges from -5 to 5, and the y-axis ranges from -5 to 5. The curve has a distinct shape with a peak at the origin (0,0) and a minimum at (5,0). There are two points marked on the curve: one at the origin (0,0) and another at (5,0). The curve appears to be a function with a symmetric shape, possibly a form of a quartic or a similar type of polynomial. The graph suggests a function that crosses the x-axis at two points and has a maximum or saddle point at the origin. \n\nThe grid helps in identifying the coordinates of points on the curve. The curve's shape indicates it might be a function like \\( y = ax^4 + bx^3 + cx^2 + dx + e \\), but the exact function is not specified. The graph is typical in mathematical analysis to visualize the behavior of such functions.",

                "response": "To solve this problem, we need to use the properties of circles and angles.\n\n1. **Identify the given information:**\n   - Points A, B, C, and D are on circle O.\n   - Point E is on the extended line of AD.\n   - \u2220ABC = 60\u00b0.\n\n2. **Understand the properties of the circle:**\n   - \u2220ABC is an inscribed angle that intercepts arc AC.\n   - The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the intercepted arc.\n\n3. **Calculate the measure of arc AC:**\n   - Since \u2220ABC = 60\u00b0, the measure of arc AC is twice the measure of \u2220ABC.\n   - Arc AC = 2 \u00d7 60\u00b0 = 120\u00b0.\n\n4. **Determine the measure of \u2220CDE:**\n   - \u2220CDE is an exterior angle formed by extending line AD.\n   - The measure of an exterior angle is equal to the difference between the measures of the intercepted arcs.\n   - Arc AC is 120\u00b0, and since point E is on the extended line of AD, arc AC is the same as arc ACDE.\n   - Therefore, \u2220CDE = 180\u00b0 - 120\u00b0 = 60\u00b0.\n\nThus, the degree of \u2220CDE is 60\u00b0.\n\n**Correct option letter: C**"
